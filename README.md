So excited to hatch a brand new website!
This is my dream land.
Only if I have a brush that I can paint all those shining colors, and fill the void.
There is beauty on earth. So many beautiful things -- Those are the purpose of life.
I heard people say "C'est la vie." when they have so little control of something.
I want my friends to say "C'est la vie." with a happy and content tone.
We are here already.
We are here anyway.
We are here of purpose.
We do not need to be perfect. 
You don't need to be perfect.
I dont have to be perfect.
In the dream land, let's create something beautiful.
