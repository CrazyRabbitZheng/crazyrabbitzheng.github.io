    <h2>Why is coding not on the list?</h2>
    <p>
      To me, coding is an approach, a mean to communicate. (to the computer, in
      this case.)
    </p>
    <p>I have other means to make a living.</p>
    <p>I tell good stories; I can be a writer.</p>
    <p>I'd like to help people; I can be a social worker.</p>
    <p>
      I'm so fansinated about interpreting my own thoughts and grabbing the
      breeze that almost evaporating away.
    </p>
    <p>I can study philosophy and philosophy.</p>

    <p>
      I chose my program at college only because my urge of coding is much
      stronger than anything else.
    </p>
    <p>
      If I'm really fond of something, I will eventually bring myself to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I acknowledged this when I started to learn playing the keyboard last
      Chistmas.
    </p>
    <p>Sounds like fate.</p>
    <p>On my life journey, I sometimes see my true desire.</p>
    <p>I know at that moment "This is inevitable."</p>
    <p>
      No matter which path I choose, I will get to theb place where my love
      resides.
    </p>
    <p>It happens natrually.</p>
    <p>Just like to paint. When all in your mind is the urge of painting.</p>
    <p>
      No brush, no canvas, no others in your mind, but the marvellous beauty
      you're painting.
    </p>
    <p>
      This happens natrually. Inevitable. Fated. Those are the things attached
      to your core.
